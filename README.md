# Tuberculosis Detection

This project involves building a deep learning model to detect tuberculosis (TB) from medical images. It uses a convolutional neural network (CNN) to classify input images, and a Flask-based web app provides an interface for users to upload images and get predictions.

## Introduction

Tuberculosis (TB) is a serious disease that primarily affects the lungs. Early detection is critical for effective treatment. This project aims to leverage deep learning to provide an automated solution for detecting TB in medical images.

---

## Features

- Upload medical images through a web interface.
- Use a trained deep learning model for tuberculosis classification.
- View results instantly.

---

## Technologies Used

- **Programming Languages:** Python, HTML, CSS  
- **Frameworks and Libraries:** Flask, TensorFlow/Keras, NumPy, OpenCV, Pillow  
- **Other Tools:** Git, Jupyter Notebook

## Installation

To run this project locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone this repository:

  ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/Tuberculosis-Detection.git
 ```
   
2. Navigate to the project directory:

    ```bash
     cd Tuberculosis-Detection
   ```

3. Create and activate a virtual environment:

   ```bash
     python -m venv venv
     source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
   ```

4. Install the required dependencies:

 ```bash
     pip install -r requirements.txt
 ```

5.Run the Flask application:

   ```bash
 python app.py
  ```
 

6. Open the web app in your browser at http://127.0.0.1:5000.

## Usage
Upload a medical image using the web interface.
Wait for the model to analyze the image.
View the prediction results.

---

## Dataset
The dataset used for training the model contains labeled medical images for tuberculosis detection. Due to data privacy concerns, the dataset cannot be shared publicly. You can use similar open-source datasets available online.

---

## Model Architecture
The deep learning model used is a convolutional neural network (CNN) with the following layers:

Convolutional layers with ReLU activation
MaxPooling layers
Dense layers for classification
Softmax activation for multi-class output
The input image dimensions are 128x128x3.

---

## API Endpoints
The Flask app exposes the following endpoints:

/predict: Accepts an image file and returns the TB detection result.

---

## Results
The trained model achieved the following metrics on the test dataset:

Accuracy: 95%
Precision: 93%
Recall: 94%
